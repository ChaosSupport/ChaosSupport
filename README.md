# Hello, I'm Christopher

I'm in IT, aka chaos support, and am expanding my talents into cloud infrastructure and automation. 

I don't aim for some impossible pristine order. I know chaos can't be completely eliminated, so I build tools to manage it and sometimes even make it work in our favor.

If that's of interest to you, then here you'll find a slowly growing collection of my personal projects: scripting fixes, automation experiments, and the occasional attempt to make the universe just a little less messy.
